## Required Parts  
(Check BOM for exact details)

- microcontroller  
- 2x pcb (pcb is reversible)  
- 1 of each required 3d printed part  
- 6x m3x8 cap head machine screws  
- switch of choice (footprints can accomadate multiple brands, I am using reddragon low profile switches)  
- 3D printed keycaps (up to personal choice of colour / design)  
- Diodes (throughhole or smd)  

## Assembly instructions

1. Solder diodes to board top.  
2. Solder headers and microcontroller to top of board.  
3. For RHS board solder together pads to reverse direction, on LHS board solder "normal" side pads together.  
4. The microcontroller headers are needed to allow the USB-C port to be accessable.  
5. Push switches through top plates.  
6. Place top plate in place, filp board upside down, and solder the switches in place.  
7. Solder Battery onto board, and place in hole in PCB.
